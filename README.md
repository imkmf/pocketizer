pocketizer is a really hastily put together way to add some URLs to Pocket.

auth first! `ruby authorizer.rb` for the worst authorization process you have ever done, ever.

open the url given to you, then come back and <CR><CR> everything forever until you get an access code.

then the magic begins: `ruby pocketizer.rb <url>`

BONUS MODE: it can take an rss feed and grab everything on it because "'*#***yolo***swag*'"

set your `.env` if you want to have a halfway decent time using this POS
